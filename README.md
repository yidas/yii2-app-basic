Yii 2 Basic Application Template with Fixed Bower

[![Latest Stable Version](https://poser.pugx.org/yidas/yii2-app-basic/v/stable)](https://packagist.org/packages/yidas/yii2-app-basic)
[![Latest Unstable Version](https://poser.pugx.org/yidas/yii2-app-basic/v/unstable)](https://packagist.org/packages/yidas/yii2-app-basic)
[![License](https://poser.pugx.org/yidas/yii2-app-basic/license)](https://packagist.org/packages/yidas/yii2-app-basic)

Let you use pure Composer to install or update Yii2 smoothly, no Bower issue anymore. 

---

INTRODUCTION
------------

This template is Fixed Bower version of [Yii 2](http://www.yiiframework.com/) basic application, which required [yidas/yii2-bower-asset](https://github.com/yidas/yii2-bower-asset) for updating composer with Bower asset.

In this template, Bower packages are fixed for current version relating to Yii2 core, so you need to manually update Bower-Asset when needed.

---

INSTALLATION
------------

### Install via Composer

If you do not have [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/), you may install it by following the instructions
at [getcomposer.org](http://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-nix).

You can then install this project template using the following command:

```
composer create-project --prefer-dist yidas/yii2-app-basic
```

Also, you can make a minimal installation without development tool:
```
composer create-project --prefer-dist --no-dev yidas/yii2-app-basic
```

> With --no-dev project, set to prod-env or remove the debug & gii usage from `config/web.php` to prevent error.

---

### Install from an Archive File

[Download yii2-app-basic-2.0.12 Archive](https://github.com/yidas/yii2-app-basic/releases/download/2.0.12/yii2-app-basic-2.0.12.tar.gz)

1. Extract the downloaded file to a  Web-accessible folder, which includes vendor already.

2. Modify the `config/web.php` file by entering a secret key for the `cookieValidationKey` configuration item:

  ```
  'request' => [
      // !!! insert a secret key in the following (if it is empty) - this is required by cookie validation
      'cookieValidationKey' => '<secret random string goes here>',
  ],
  ```
3. Check and modify the permission of `runtime` and `web/assets` folders to `777` if needed.
